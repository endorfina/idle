# idle

### About

*Boo!* ðŸ‘»
Idle is an OpenGL vector graphics engine targeted for X11 and Android's NDK.
The project's prime objective is to help me deal with lingering symptoms of ptsd.

Requires a C++17 compiler to be available.
Depends on linking against freetype, alsa and GLX - instructions for installing these can be found in the section below.
Idle also includes a slightly modified [SoLoud](http://sol.gfxile.net/soloud/) library for xmod playback as well as [lodepng](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) for image decoding.

### Building

Just run the associated bash script:
```sh
./configure.sh && make
```

Configure script accepts some flags, however by default it will prepare a proper CMake release build.
`-l` flag forces the build system to use both clang and libc++ for compilation.
`-n` translates to `-march=native -mtune=native`.
`-j` will try to merge the core library files into a jumbo build.
Personally I'd recommend running `./configure.sh -nj` for an optimal solution.
There are others but they're mostly for development (and quite straightforward).
